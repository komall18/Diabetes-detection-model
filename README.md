# Diabetes-detection-model

Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious health complications. The early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing these complications and improving overall health outcomes. Machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to diabetes detection by leveraging data on various demographic, clinical, and biochemical factors to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset.

In this project, our objective is to develop a robust predictive model for diabetes detection using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing information on individuals' age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, genetic predisposition, and other relevant factors, we aim to build a model capable of accurately predicting the presence or absence of diabetes.

Proposed Methodology

• Data Understanding: Identified relevant features in the diabetes dataset, including name, age, biomedical history, blood sugar levels, hypertension etc. that might be relevant for predicting the target variable.
• Data Pre-processing: Encoded categorical features into numerical values suitable for the desired data mining algorithms. Techniques such as one-hot encoding were used for this purpose.
• Feature Selection: Calculated information gain for each feature to assess its predictive power as features with higher values are more likely to be informative for the model. Selected the top 'k' features based on their information gain to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
• Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized optimization techniques such as Hyperopt, a Bayesian optimization library, Optuna, another popular library that utilizes a similar approach to Hyperopt, and Random Search to find the best hyperparameter combinations for the chosen models.
• Model Training and Evaluation: Split the data into training and testing sets and trained the model(s) with different hyperparameter configurations and evaluated their performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
• Data Visualization: Visualized relationships between features and the target variable using techniques such as scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.
• Deployment: Selected the Random Search algorithm to deploy the trained model. The trained model is serialized using the pickle library for ease of deployment using a Flask web application framework, HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly interface where users can input their data. The application runs on a web server, allowing users to access the prediction service through a web browser. For inputs, users provide their health data, including age, hypertension status, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level, through an input form on the web page.
Upon submission of the input data, the Flask application processes the data, makes predictions using the deployed model, and returns the prediction results, indicating whether the user is predicted to have diabetes or not.
